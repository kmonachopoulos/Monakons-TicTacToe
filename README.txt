This is a simple TicTacToe game that i made just for fun!! It runs on Matlab. 

Instrucitons :

To set the coordinates on the board you can just press the raw and the column of the coordinate on Command Prompt.E.g the number 13 refers to first raw, third column, the number 32 refers to third raw, second column and so on.At the end of the game either a winner or a draw will be announced.
